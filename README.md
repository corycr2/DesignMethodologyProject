# Design Methodology Project
This class we were tasked with creating the general tools that an engineer would use. These tools included, a voltmeter, an ohmmeter, a DC reference, a square wave generator, a sine wave generate, and a method for reading frequency of a wave. We were provided with a limited amount of integrated circuit(IC) chips. We were not able to use ICs outside of the ones provided. We were allowed to use any number of resistors, capacitors and other components that were not ICs.

# Voltmeter Requirements
The voltmeter we were tasked to make has to read from 0-4 volts in .25v increments. 

# Ohmmeter Requirements 
The ohmmeter had to read from 100 ohms - 10000 ohms.

# DC Reference Requirements
The DC reference need to output voltages to a load from 0-4 volts in .25v increments.

# Square Wave Generator Requirements
The square wave had a set amplitude of 5 volts centered on the 2.5v line. This meant that the output should be 0 and 5 volts. The square wave had to output this at frequencies of 100-10000 Hz.

# Sine Wave Generator Requirements
The sine wave generator had to have a variable amplitude from .25-5v. The next requirement was that the bottom of the had to be at the 0v line meaning none of the waves should be negative. The sine wave had to reach a frequency range of 1000 - 10000 Hz.

# Frequency Read Requirements
We should be able to read frequencies within the 100-10000 Hz range. This frequency read should work with typical waves i.e. (square, sine, triangle, etc.)
